# Calendar Notes Pro 🗓️📝

A sleek, intuitive, and powerful calendar-based note-taking application built entirely **without any frameworks** – just **vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS**.

## 🚀 Why This Project Is Unique

While calendar-based note-taking apps are common, **this project stands out because it's built from scratch without relying on any frontend framework** like React, Vue, or Angular. This means:
- No dependencies beyond a few style/CDN libraries (like QuillJS and Font Awesome).
- Pure JavaScript DOM manipulation and state management.
- A deep understanding of browser APIs and performance optimization.
- Greater control over how every piece of the app behaves, looks, and interacts.

This isn't just a template thrown together with tools — it's handcrafted.
